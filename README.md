# Anomaly-Detection-in-IoT-Data
This solution is a deep learning-based trainable algorithm, capable of detecting anomalous behavior in IoT sensor data.

## Product Highlight
* This solution is a deep learning-based approach to learn and understand the patterns in IoT sensor data. It aims at learning the normal behavior patterns of the sensor data during training process using generative algorithms. Once trained, the model can identify abnormal signals from the sensor and classify them as anomalous.
* It learns normal IoT sensor patterns using non-anomalous data and builds a 1-rule threshold model using data from both classes. It then identifies the anomalous behavior of the sensor using inclusion-exclusion principle. The solution is also re-trainable to capture information drift. 
* This solution is capable of handling huge amounts of class imbalance and capturing anomalous behavior. 
* InfraGraf is a patented Cognitive infrastructure automation platform that optimizes enterprise technology infrastructure investments. It diagnoses and predicts infrastructure failures. Need customized Machine Learning and Deep Learning solutions? Get in touch!
